GAME THEORY QUIZ - INSTALLATION AND USAGE GUIDE
================================================================================

PROJECT OVERVIEW
----------------
A GUI-based study program that presents 50 randomized multiple-choice
questions per session to help prepare for Game Theory exams. Features
immediate feedback, real-time score tracking, and comprehensive coverage
of key Game Theory concepts.


SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
-------------------
- Python 3.6 or higher
- Operating System: Windows, macOS, or Linux
- Display: Minimum 900x700 resolution recommended


INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
--------------------------

1. VERIFY PYTHON INSTALLATION
   Open a terminal/command prompt and run:

   python --version

   OR

   python3 --version

   You should see Python 3.6 or higher. If not, download from:
   https://www.python.org/downloads/


2. DOWNLOAD THE PROGRAM
   Clone this repository or download the files:

   git clone https://github.com/Xarbin/AI_Financial_Markets_Homework.git
   cd AI_Financial_Markets_Homework

   OR download the ZIP file and extract it.


3. NO ADDITIONAL DEPENDENCIES REQUIRED
   The program uses only Python standard library modules:
   - tkinter (included with Python)
   - random (included with Python)

   Note: On some Linux systems, tkinter may need to be installed separately:

   Ubuntu/Debian:
   sudo apt-get install python3-tk

   Fedora:
   sudo dnf install python3-tkinter

   Arch Linux:
   sudo pacman -S tk


RUNNING THE PROGRAM
-------------------

1. NAVIGATE TO THE PROGRAM DIRECTORY
   cd path/to/Game_Theory


2. RUN THE QUIZ
   Windows:
   python game_theory_quiz.py

   macOS/Linux:
   python3 game_theory_quiz.py


3. ALTERNATIVE: DOUBLE-CLICK (Windows)
   On Windows, you can double-click the game_theory_quiz.py file if
   Python is properly associated with .py files.


USAGE INSTRUCTIONS
------------------

1. START SCREEN
   - Click "Start Quiz" to begin
   - Each session presents 50 random questions


2. ANSWERING QUESTIONS
   - Read the question carefully
   - Select one of the four answer choices (A-D)
   - Click "Submit Answer" to check your response
   - Review the immediate feedback and explanation
   - Click "Next Question" to continue


3. PROGRESS TRACKING
   - Current question number and total (e.g., "Question 10/50")
   - Real-time score display
   - Visual progress bar


4. RESULTS SCREEN
   - View your final score and percentage
   - Get performance feedback
   - Click "Restart Quiz" to try again with new randomized questions
   - Click "Exit" to close the program


QUESTION BANK DETAILS
----------------------
- Total Questions: 58+ questions in the bank
- Session Length: 50 randomly selected questions
- Question Types:
  * Conceptual understanding (dominant strategies, Nash equilibrium, etc.)
  * Mathematical calculations (expected utility, probabilities, etc.)
- Topics Covered:
  * Dominant and dominated strategies
  * Nash equilibrium (pure and mixed strategies)
  * Best responses
  * Expected utility and payoffs
  * Zero-sum and non-zero-sum games
  * Minimax and maximin principles
  * Repeated games and the Folk Theorem
  * Bayesian games (incomplete information)
  * Mechanism design and incentive compatibility
  * Prisoner's Dilemma and coordination games
  * Pareto efficiency
  * Evolutionary stable strategies (ESS)


TROUBLESHOOTING
---------------

PROBLEM: "python: command not found" or "python3: command not found"
SOLUTION: Python is not installed or not in PATH. Install Python from
          python.org and ensure "Add Python to PATH" is checked during
          installation.


PROBLEM: "ModuleNotFoundError: No module named '_tkinter'"
SOLUTION: Tkinter is not installed. See step 3 under Installation
          Instructions for OS-specific installation commands.


PROBLEM: Window appears too small or text is cut off
SOLUTION: The window is resizable. Drag the corners to make it larger.
          Minimum recommended resolution is 900x700.


PROBLEM: Questions repeat in the same session
SOLUTION: This only occurs if you restart the quiz. Each session randomly
          selects 50 questions from the bank of 58+. Some repetition across
          sessions is normal.


PROBLEM: Program crashes or freezes
SOLUTION: Close and restart the program. Ensure no other application is
          interfering with tkinter. If issues persist, check Python version
          compatibility.

CUSTOMIZATION (ADVANCED)
------------------------
To add or modify questions, edit the QUESTION_BANK list in
game_theory_quiz.py (starting around line 17).

Each question follows this structure:
{
    "question": "Your question text here?",
    "options": ["Option A", "Option B", "Option C", "Option D"],
    "correct_answer": "Option B",
    "explanation": "Brief explanation of the correct answer."
}


TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS
-------------------------
- Language: Python 3
- GUI Framework: Tkinter
- Architecture: Single standalone file
- Data Storage: In-memory (no external files required)
- Question Selection: Random sampling without replacement per session
- Answer Randomization: Options shuffled for each question
